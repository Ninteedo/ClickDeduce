# Coverage

The automatically generated coverage reports appear in the `[coverage](../coverage)` directory, but this is not 
included in the repository.

There is a copy of the final coverage reports before submission in the [`softtest/coverage`](./coverage) directory,
which this document will refer to.

## Scala

The Scala coverage report is generated using the IntelliJ IDEA coverage tool and can be viewed 
[here](./coverage/scala/index.html).

## TypeScript

The TypeScript coverage report is generating using Jest with the `--coverage` flag and can be viewed
[here](./coverage/jest/lcov-report/index.html).
