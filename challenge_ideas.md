# Challenge Ideas

This is a list of ideas for tasks that a new user could attempt for each language.
These are designed to be simple tasks that introduce the student to how the new language features work.

## LArith

1. Create an expression which evaluates to 42.
2. Create an expression which uses the `Plus` expression.
3. Create an expression which uses both the `Plus` and `Times` expressions.
4. View the type-checking tree.
5. View the evaluation tree.

## LIf

1. Create an expression which evaluates to `true`.
2. Create an expression which uses the `IfThenElse` expression.
3. Create a complete expression which does not successfully type-check.

## LLet
